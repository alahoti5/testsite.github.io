		Attachments is Cause of Suffering
	</h1>

	 <p>
		Attachment is defined as a feeling where you find yourself bounded with something and expect to get plesure from that boundage.
		A bondage is a bondage, even if it gives you pleasure for sometime it will ultimately result in pain because that is the rule of duality.

		Nothing in this world will give you plesure which stays forever. if you are getting pleasure one day, other day the wheel will turn and cause a lot of pain.
		Now its very obvious but the human nature is to run after pleasure and that's why they get attached to things. Once the attachment is formed it will lead to bondage.
		The bondage will make you do things in a certain way. and when somebody is bounded, their freedom is lost. 
		When the freedom is lost then no matter how happening the thing is, it will soon lose its charm and will become painful.
